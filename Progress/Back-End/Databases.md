## Progress Update #1

As I continue to learn PHP and practice concepts by working on my own projects, I have finally started to learn MySQL and how it works with PHP.  I've been going through a MySQL Udemy course (see resources) to get a better understanding of advanced MySQL concepts.

For the most part, the SQL I've used in my PHP projects have been the same.  They involve querying the database with various CRUD features (SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DROP, etc) and just getting the associated information.  For that reason, I am separating PHP from MySQL.  

The course I am taking on Udemy covers advanced MySQL features that I haven't used in any of my PHP projects yet, but my goal is to better understand all aspects of SQL even if I'm not using them yet.

As of 1/20/2018 I have completed 8 sections from the Udemy course and plan on finishing the entire course before the end of February.

I am tracking my progress for this course using this [trello board](https://trello.com/b/YQnqjgCF/mysql-udemy)
